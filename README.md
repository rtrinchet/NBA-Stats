Fetch NBA Stats and Salaries data

## Possible ideas


### Create a database with the data obtained from web scrapping from:

* [B-Ref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/): to get regular season & playoff game stats and advanced stats. Also, get salaries information and college data.

### Model the relation between stats and salaries

### Model the relation between college stats and draft position

### Model the relation between draft position and total career earnings
